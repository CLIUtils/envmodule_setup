#  EnvModule Setup

This is a collection of useful scripts for setting up Lmod. These are example files, as well as a powerful environment capture script for Python/Plumbum in `/scripts`.

See the [guide for CentOS7](docs/CentOS7.md) to see some instructions for use. If you use macOS, you can link the macOS folder to your Lmod location.
